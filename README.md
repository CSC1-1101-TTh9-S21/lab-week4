# Week 4 Lab and Class Exercises

## Debugging (Class 4.1)
In this repo are three python files. Download this repo, and then try to run each of these three programs in IDLE. Figure out what is wrong with each one, and then fix them. You won't always get an error message, but something will always be wrong!

## Exercises (Lab and for fun at home)

### Part 1: `for` loops

1. Print out every number between 10 and 100.

2. Print out every other number between 10 and 50 starting with 10.

3. Do a countdown backwards from 100 to 50.

4. Do a countdown backwards from 100 by 7’s (so 100, 93, 86, 79…)

### Part 2: Nested if statements and `and`, `or` in `if`, `while`
You are giving out prizes to people based on their age, name, and number of cats. Write a program that asks a user for each of these data points, and then print out which prize they get based on the following criteria:

1. People under 18 whose names begin with “E" win a new car, uness they have exactly 2 cats.

2. People between 25 and 50 (inclusive) whose names contain at least one “a" or one "o" win a candy bar. 

3. People with more than 5 cats who are over 60 get a new house, but people will more than 5 cats who are between 50 and 60 (exclusive) get a shiny nickle.

### Part 3: Modules
1. Generate a random number between 0 and 1 with `random.random()`. Use an if statement to round up to 1 or down to 2, and print out the rounded output.

2. Read in a file and Use `re.sub()` to replace every `e` in a file with `E`, then print it out.
